## Additional info
I implemented the UI guided by the given layout. After that, I learned and implemented *GraphQL* queries and mutations using *Apollo Client*. I have implemented a simpler version of the form to save some time.

One of my **favorite challenges** on this project was taking the values on the form to the create mutation because it made me struggle. I heard about *React Hook Form* a little bit late, and although I tried implementing it I did'nt have enough time to redo the form using this Library. I really enjoyed developing this app because it made me learn a lot, furthermore I think I could have done more with a little extra time.
